Every English sentence has a verb, a part of speech which denotes an action (to read), an occurrence (to decompose) or a state (to exist). In Russian, there are many constructions which do not require the use of a verb in a sentence. Such constructions often describe emotional or physical states, for example <em>Ему холодно</em> (He is cold), <em>Здесь скучно</em> (It’s boring here),<em> Мне нужно идти</em> (I need/I have to go), <em>Мне можно войти?</em> (May I come in?). As you can see, English uses verbs in these phrases (is, need, have to, may).

Russian does not use verbs in these constructions, it uses adverb-type words, usually ending -о (<em>холодн<u>о</u>, скучн<u>о</u>, нужн<u>о</u>, можн<u>о</u></em>). These Russian constructions have no subject and are called impersonal constructions. The person who is affected by the described state is marked by a word (noun or pronoun) in the dative case form, so literal translation of the above examples would be:
